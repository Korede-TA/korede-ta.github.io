<b> Programmer, Photographer and College student from <a class="link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/7Ecr9TqkAkF2">Lagos, Nigeria</a>. </b>

I'm fascinated with human creativity and cybernetics and i like asking questions building technology platforms in the intersection of these subjects. 
And i'm most interested in the subset of these questions that pertain to Africa and the Global South.

<p>
	I'm a college student from <a class="link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/7Ecr9TqkAkF2">Lagos, Nigeria</a> who's fascinated with people as well as various topics in computing particularly cryptoeconomics, distributed computing and programming systems. I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of these subjects. 
	The subset of these questions that fascinates me the most are those that pertain to Africa and the Global South.
</p>

<p>
	I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations while interning on engineering teams at Google and Coinbase, where I worked on ML and Blockchain oriented infrastructure projects as well as developer productivity tools.
</p>

<p>Some of my free time is spent working on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/korede-ta">open source projects</a>. The rest of it is spent at the gym or on the internet.</p>

<p>
	If you're interested in subscribing to a steady stream of my random thoughts, check me out <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/korede_ta">on twitter</a>.
	And if you'd also like to see some of the photos I infrequently take and even less frequently post on the internet, see <a class="link" href="/photos/">this page</a>. 
</p>

<p>
	I've also got something of a <a href="https://www.notion.so/log-drafts-bbd9fba375e042ffba0d18ab195b4467">blog</a>, where everything is always a draft.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual conversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over coffee), feel free to email me at korede [at] drexel [dot] edu.
