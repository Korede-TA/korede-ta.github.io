			<h3>Programmer and Photographer</h3>

			<p>
				I'm fascinated with people, data and computing and I like asking questions about building information technology platforms in the intersection of these subjects. 
				The subset of these questions that fascinates me the most are those that pertain to Africa and the Global South.
			</p>

			<p>In the past, I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations and interest while working on engineering teams at Google and a few other places.</p>

			<p>Some of my free time is spent working on challenging and intriguing <a href="https://github.com/korede-ta">open source projects</a>. </p>

			<p>
