			<h3>Software Engineer and Photograhy Enthusiast</h3>
			</br>

			<p>
				I'm fascinated with computing and data nd I like asking questions about how to use them to build information platforms. And I'm particularly fascinated with the problems that can be solved with these
				in the context of Africa.
			</p>

			<p>In the past, I've gotten the opportunity to further explore my fascinations while working on cool engineering teams at places like Google.</p>

			<p>Some of my free time is spent working on challenging and fascinating <a href="https://github.com/korede-ta">open source projects</a>. </p>

			<p>
