			<h3>Programmer and Photographer</h3>

			<p>
				I'm fascinated with people, data and computing and I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of these subjects. 
				The subset of these questions that fascinates me the most are those that pertain to Africa and the Global South.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations and interest while working on engineering teams at Google and Coinbase, mostly on infrastructure engineering teams.
			</p>

			<p>Some of my free time is spent working on <a href="https://github.com/korede-ta">open source projects</a>. The rest of it is spent at the gym or on the internet.</p>

			<p>
				If you're interested in subscribing to a steady stream of my random thoughts, check me out <a href="https://twitter.com/korede_ta">here</a>.
				And if you'd also like to see some of the photos I infrequently take and even less frequently post on the internet, go
				<a href="https://500px.com/korede_">here</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/korede_aderele">here</a>.

				Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual coversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over coffee), feel free to email me at korede [at] drexel [dot] edu.
			</p>

			<p>
				P.S. At some point i'm going to set up a blog on here as well so stay tuned for that :)
