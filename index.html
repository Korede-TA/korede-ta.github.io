		<h1>Hi, My name is Korede</h1>
		</br>
		<p>
			I like to build things and I'm going to school to learn how to do that for a living.

			<a href="https://github.com/korede-ta">Here</a> are somethings that I've built/am building.

			I also think aloud a lot and if you'd like to get a steady stream of some of these thoughts, check me out <a href="https://twitter.com/korede_ta">here</a>.
