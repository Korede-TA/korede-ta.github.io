# Crypto in Prisons

Nov 14, 2018

*file this under stupid ideas*

should start by noting that i personally believe that the fundamental solution to prisons is to abolish their current form totally. that's a bit of a lofty goal so i'm going to try to articulate some ideas around how crypto could really fulfil its potential of building an open and inclusive financial system with prisons & ex-felons.
