# Philosophy vs Sociology

Fundamentally, people don’t think in terms of distinct philosophies, but instead in terms of various socializations they’ve been subject to. So trying to analyze human systems in terms of philosophies instead of socializations is futile. By extension, communities or demographics are not goverened in behaviour and circumstance by their philosophies but are instead at the whim of the sociologies they subscribe or are subject to.
