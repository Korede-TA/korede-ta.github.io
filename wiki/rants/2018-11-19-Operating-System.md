# Operating System?

Nov 19, 2018

I really like the term "Operating System" because of how flexible it fundamentally is. It's something that transcends well outside of computing and represents, in my opinion, a sort of intermediary or translator between humans and systems which provide a series of capabilities. 

With this fundamental property in mind, i think there's much to explore around the gradual evolution in what we consider to be an operating system for computers, as well as the different intermediary systems that essentially fulfil the role of "operating system" in different facets of our lives. For example, Amazon is gradually fulfilling the role of operating system for human consumption, kind of like an interface between the everyday person and the capitalistic consumption complex... providing the digital and physical storefronts for all the tangible and intangible things we consume (see [this note](https://www.notion.so/korede/Consumption-vs-Creation-59c65bb415b447e2bebd055bfea446d0)).

This raises a question what are some other things for whch operating systems exist or need to exist? What about an operating system for creation or education

Here's something else: i just came across a reference to an operating system (in the context of computers) as something that dues two fundamental things: providing hardware abstraction and multiplexing resources â†’ how does this idea hold when expanded into non-computing contexts? what systems provide abstractions over the bare-bones activities in a context and help us manage our resources (monetary, cognitive e.t.c.) and distribute them amongst tasks or processes?
