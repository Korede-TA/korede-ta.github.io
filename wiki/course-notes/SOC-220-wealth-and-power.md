marxist POV on wealth: two main classes: bourgeoisie and proletariat. the proletariat (literally meaning "baby people"), bourgeoisie are the owners of the means of production 

pluralism: a plurality of different kinds of political interest, in the context of classes, not dissimilar to liberalism. 

class warfare: class warfare

details of political spectrum

**religious right**

- generally of the opinion that the govenment should be aligned to their religoius/moral stances.
- tend to look to the past as ideals, as opposed to liberals who believe the future will be better
- tend to be fundamentalist/literalist (of both the bible and the constitution (?) )

**ultra conservatives**

- reacting to liberal policy as "out of control" and undermining of "fundamental"
 american principles
- tending to be individualistic or libertarian
- concerned with military strength
- conspiratorial in outlook towards national problems
- —> had "neo confederacy", "white supremacy" arise out of fringe status to more prominence within the party, esp seeing as subtly appealing to them has long been a republican policy point. this fragment believes in some sort of impending "race war

**moderate conservatives**

- "business conservatives"
- centrist in outlook
- preferring moderation

**labor**

- while largely liberal, have a history of division along gender and race lines
- more business-oriented than militant as compared to the 1930s, very recently have been more inclined towards formal dealings than revolts of any form

**liberals**

- often in coalition with labor
- —> evolved towards "neo-liberalism" with a fundamentalist stance on the market and its efficacy,.. from FDR-era liberalism
- —> "neo-conservatism" is a center-ish stance, viewing the USA as the sole world power → insinuating that the US would have to use military, intelligence, security effort to take control of oil sources to prevent russia and china (and/or india) from gaining this control in their place → "wolfenstein doctrine" after the architect of this plan in the bush admin

// all above groups are fundamentally capitalist and believe in it's efficacy over government-lead solutions

**progressives**

- significantly more anti-capitalist/socialist than other groups

## religious right/conservatives and media

religious right started off as under-the-radar radio shows with lots of spreading of religious pov and solutions on various societal issues.

they were able to innovate by polluting factual reporting with a more editorial style and the reflection of skewed points of view

## corporation

**corporation as a living thing** → a group of individuals with common goals which can outlive even the individuals that it consists

**corporation as an agreement/contract** → a set of legal agreements/contracts that define the relationships and bounds thereof between members, especially in the context of profit splitting and governance of the larger body (jointly referred to as, stake)

**directors as central to the corporation** → ****boards of directors often serve as the one defining top-level feature of corporations which are responsible for decision amaking, governance, revenue allocation/compensation e.t.c.

**melding of banks and trusts/corporations** → going from an age of banks being specific to industries and the trusts who governed them (ex: mellon bank for the steel industry controlled by the carnegie steel industries trust), to an age of this industry-specific bank function being absorbed into the larger corporation (ex: general electics bank function being more powerful/profitable than its regular marketing function)

**corporations as community** → from a basic sociological pov: a place where families live, a home to institutions that service these families such as churches or grocery stores, core organizations such as a local government or a police force, members of said communties are always interacting through 

*note that: consumers and non-high-level workers/employees are not represented within the corporate community*

**corporation as a liability shield** → corporations are often used as a proxy for personal debt and can be used to sheild you from liability because they are treated as independent legal entities or "individuals" in the eyes of the law — a phenomenon that took century long evolution as influenced by the notion of non-business corporations

**education as hinged on class**

**upper class institutions**

the upper class in general is a dense network of social groups + families + networks

family offices which were in charge of how fortunes were managed as well as things like trust fund management for offspring

charities, PACs and things like that which are used to exert political influence and control leadership

notes on capitalism (chapter 4)

- the central idea in the economic system that is capitalism is *capital*
- capital in the context of private property → the idea of owning things, which ties into the idea of investing/loaning money and recieving it back
- the transition of capitalism into the industrial age where, instead of capital generation being dependent on human or animal labor, started to depend on steam and electricity

## tuesday

the network for the upper class VS mass media information sharing

structure of the power elite:

- social upper class
- policy planning network
- corporate community

these main groups have intersections that define the "power elite"

the main argument

- intersection of network and organizational structures
- developing and presenting ideas and reports ot the decision makers
- money funds primarily ultra conservative agenda → hybrid of neoliberalism and neo-conservatism (aka "unilateralism")

the process flow

- problems identifies as "issues" for new policy solutions in boardrooms and clubs and informal closed forums
- from issues within the Corporate Communication → Foundations → Think tanks → Policy discussion groups
    - **foundations** serve as non-profit means to distribute money for the upper class in order to exert their influence
    - **think tanks** are a sort of "hired education"/"intellectual hired labor" which serve as research institutions (much like universities) that are obligated to bring out reports/papers on the point of view of the elite funders. are made up of analysts, professors, lawyers and general researchers who are lucratively compensated
    - **policy discussion groups** are a further initiatives that encourage "invitation-only" luncheon discussions bringing together business, government leaders and members of the  academic community e.t.c. forr informal exploration of differenes of opinion and points of agreement
        - after these informal discussions are more formalized, they are formed into **blue ribbon commissions and task forces** that interact more directly with senate and congress members and pass reports to them that are debated on the senate/house floors in order to become law. direct appointees from PDGs are also brought in to work in the government
        - sometimes, think tanks or foundations might pass down testimonies/reports directly to government

    Domhoff calls this process by which members of the elite exert their opinions for policy "upper class democracy".

**network analysis**

nodes, organizational ties: 

- common sources of funding, shared individuals on boards
- example: analysis of business council and business roundtable

foundations:

- out of 70,000 independent foundations, only 25 family foundations accounted for 90% of the cash flow, only a few dozen of the total account for the majority of the policy impact giving more than $500,000

issue of legitimacy:

- universities and groups which host views of

liberal-labor policy network:

- liberal-labor think tanks and their funding (p. 103)
    - center on budget and policy priorities
    - center on american progress
    - economic policy institute
    - new america foundation

generally a lot smaller than 

in terms of classes and exerting political power is by virtue of their organization, 

- the upper class is incredibly organized by institutions and networks tied together by money
- the middle class in comparison is far less organized if at all
- the working class used to have trade unions as the primary mechanism of organization while subsequent classes

non-elite opinion shaping network

- manufacturing consent
    - average citizens & engaged public
    - PR firms & deparments at corporations
    - stories/new/metanarratives:
        - new as a consumable commodity inseparable from infotainment
        - newsiness and truthiness from 700 club, to Daily Show to Post Truth, Fake News, Altenative Facts, Reality Show Realit
    - creating and cultivating disengagement
    - **metanarratives** determined by the culture, often capitalist leaning that translates to the american dream of working hard and getting rewarded accordingly
        - see page 113 for example of working class self blame due to american ideology of "just desserts"
        - news becoming commoditized leads us to a post-truth era where the integrity of news is thinned out and determined based moreso on the metanarratives we subscribe to as opposed to any form of objectivity

*next class: manufacturing consent, **the free press as the major democratic institution of the middle class***

## media, news and shaping public opinion (recap)

despite the fact that independent media is the back-bone of democratic society, modern times have reduced the work of press and journalists often to content aggregators to maximize profit for the owners. 

some models suggest that more power be given to journalists and editors in the form of unions to allow the more control over

the primary reason media agency's have become content aggregators is because they need to compete with popular social media platforms which are governed by algorithms.

these algorithm-driven media are a problem because they are skewed towards creating echo chambers and cause the national conversation to be fragmented instead of there being a singular, non-biased sources of information like in the past. *a transition from news to multiple stories.*

inasmuch as social media allows marginalized narratives and viewpoints to be upheld.  

outside of the elite's public relations engines, the media is the main way in which the public is involved in/has agency over opinion-shaping

the transition in media recently is seeing marks it's transition from independence to being more like opinionated public relations

## parties and elections

- rules around election — voter suppression, gerrymandering, ID laws — translate to tools for "legally" excluding and disenfranchising voters
- political power & growth coalitions
- two-party system → considered somewhat tyrannous because representation of different viewpoints is not sufficiently uniform across the political spectrum. "winner-takes-all representation" of electorate is strongly restrictive to how democracy should work.
    - the parliamentary system mitigates this and makes the representation more proportional
- 

**domhoff on the dems and the repubs:**

- both corporate parties with similar/parallel agendas:
- both centered neoliberal and neoconservative agendas
- have swapped bases:
    - dems shift from liberal labor alliance under clinton in 90s
    - repub shift to dixiecrat & ultra conservative neoliberal + social conservative agendas, following 1968 before further shift in 1980's
    - → dem party used to be concentrated on trade unions alongside civil rights but now ignores trade/workers rigths... allowing the republican party to push this as their agenda instead
- both fail to deliver to their bases:
    - repubs can't shrink govt, make america christian and white
    - dems are fine w jobless recovery and wealth transfer as long as it is inclusively meritrocratic
- *follow the money to really understand these parties*

**roles and function of government** 

- pluralism vs elite/class framework
- regulate people,products,money supply and enforce those rules
- create money, set interest rates, shaping credit system
- special interest competitions and conflicts
    - advisory councils and lobbying groups
    - "regulatory capture"

# neoliberalism

a few questions:

- who is Noam Chomsky?
- what 3 things
- what is the anthropocene?

    era in which humans began to have a dominant effect on the natural environment and climate. anthropocene was a combination of political, industrial effects e.t.c → this implies that the fate of the planet in terms of survival of humanity due to the environment/climate will be determined by what humans do and don't do.

- what is neoliberalism?  —> connection between neoliberalism and the anthropocene?

    neoliberalism came about as a result of acknowledging the anthropocene and attempting to mitigate it. came about in the 1970s and brought in by Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan is most associated with it.

    - chomsky's gripes with neoliberlism?
        - he viewed it as a way of over-individualizing social systems and eliminating solidarity amongst individuals
        - he also argued that it attempts to dismantle the government and hence the ability for it to control the corporations → what follows is an inversion where the corporations control the government

            ***"if the government doesn't control the corporations, the corporations will control the government"***

    neoliberalism also came about as a recourse by the powers that be to control the increasing number of social movements (civil rights, anti-war in vietnam e.t.c.) by dismantling solidarity

    neoliberalism, from an economic standpoint and a leftist point of view, represented a technique for reconcentrating wealth in the top 3 or 4%

- what are the special interests that neoliberals fight against

other notes:

David Harvey — prominent author and pioneering commentator on neoliberalism. referred to neoliberalism as a "revolution"

identified a few prominent leaders:

- Margaret Thatcher → leader of the revolution on the European side as PM of Britain
- Ronald Reagan → leader on the American side
    - reagan and thatcher were the two main world leaders that pushed neoliberalism

    *it would be interesting to explore how the neoliberalism revolution affected colonial outlooks, bringing about neocolonialism and the African debt crisis*

- Deng Xiaoping → leader on the Chinese side, especially in pushing
- Augusto Pinochet → repressive chilean leader who was placed in by a CIA-backed coup over the popular leader who some would consider Salvador Allende "chilean Bernie Sanders" (who nationalized the copper mines, angering the copper companies who also supported the CIA in the plan)

**five historical stages of neoliberalism**

a series of very fast restructuring of organizational structures → seeing non-profits behave more like for-profit company

- Revolution: 1973-1983
- Consolidation: 1984-1990 — period when both Reagan and thatcher were reelected, conquest over "socialist" nations and enemies in the soviet union and Satellites (Cuba, Poland e.t.c.)
- Triumphalism: 1991-2007 — period of "we have no enemies, we have won"
- Crisis: 2008-now —  the financial crisis
- End Game: coming soon 😈 — *the political crisis* sparked by populism and the collapse of the center

properties include:

- status quo = neoliberal politics
- super wealth concentration, rentism (charging increasingly exorbitantly for services), corporate power, debt service economy, 10% vs the 90%

	**rentism** reflects the common profit paradigm of charging minimally over long periods of time for perpetual profit, "passive income"

"fork in the road" circa 1978 → 2 kinds of economies, the kind we're used to and Brazil which was a very unequal society with tiny 

"death to keynsianism", "death to liberal 'socialism'", with **keynsianism** referring to "your grandfather's capitalism" around industrialism and growing middle class, new deal e.t.c.

**keynsianism** was designed to prevent the rise of communist/socialist radicalism. an approach to "save" capitalism through a political-economic strategy by giving people a higher standard of living through government intervention

otherwise known as **social democracy** ala European/Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden.

→ achieved through a social partnership between labor and corporations, mediated by the government

set about in the FDR era through the economic bill of rights

rule of thirds: 1/3 wealth to state, 1/3 wealth to labor, 1/3 wealth to capital

—>>>> one parallel thought is that the current technology paradigm has allowed capital/corporations to concentrate wealth amongst themselves while starving labor and exerting more influence on government, as evidenced through data conglomeration and AI are helping big tech cos grow astronomically and exert more and more control. in what ways does decentralized technology, open platforms and end-user oriented tooling help redistribute this power towards the proletariat.

some of the strategies keynesianism includes:

- make higher education free or very strategy → recognizing how this is one of the best engines of social mobility and greatly reducing the barrier to entry
- nationalize healthcare
- mediate between labor and
- people believed that every year would spell an increase in quality of living and income → hence birthing the american dream in a sense

**this era came to an end towards the 1970** but was set off at the end of ww2 with the US coming to dominance as the only healthy economy

- US sees itself as rebuilding the world and setting its foothold as the world superpower → formulated the martial plan to pump money into europe
	- this order triggered imperialism and neo-colonialism through debt regimes in the developing world → especially Africa

		marked the transition from old-style militarial colonialism which was lead by conqueror countries like france and britain who used said nations as targets for goods export and controlled their political systems

		→ to more socioeconomics-based colonialism often triggered by US control in collaboration with the own nations upper class (often old money people who were foreign educated and supported by foreign governments and corporations), which evolved into political control and gave targets for importing goods and raw materials through *cheaper labor — **perspective here is important in describing what neo-liberal colonialism looks like from the perspectives of other countries***

		this transition evolved into the disappearance of the industrial-base in american cities.. which was initially 

the rule of thirds in neoliberalism looked more like: 1/10 wealth to state (from middle class), 1/10 to labor, 4/5 to capital

the government has been stripped of it's ability to give economic guarantees. 

thatcher's misquoting of marx in saying "there's no such thing as society, only individuals" → she used it to imply that there's no need for solidarity within classes or mediation between labor and capital e.t.c. → she used her middle class background and perspective to argue for this "don't live beyond your means" and "living beyond your means is immoral" — all perspectives which make sense empirically on a macro scale, but when scaled up.. you realize that governments or businesses are not able to exist without even temporary deficits

—>>>>> i'm not thinking about some of the nuance around 

**Neoclassical economic theory**

- rational actor theory, free markets and capitalism as human nature
- big government is bad and businesses and corporations are good
- "trickle down" supply side economics
- crush unions and similar social movements
- shock doctrine — lets get rid of all social spending, "fast-moving austerity"
	- allows for money to be made off all kinds of resources → commoditizing everything from healthcare to textbooks (things that should otherwise be viewed as human rights)
- anti-thetical to keynesianism

	theories go back to Hayek and Adam Smith

**in practice: a tale of two American capitalisms**

from government-labor solidarity-based industrial capitalism (1945-1975) ***→to→*** (1984-now) *wealth transfer* to the top 1%

**wealth transfer**

the major mechanisms by which wealth was siphoned from the working class to 

- cumulative price inflation
- wage stagnation
- accelerated productivity
- regressive taxes
- mega consumer credit debt
- throw away employees aka "gig economy"
- for-profitization of public goods (non-consumer resources) → healthcare, education,

much of this credit-based economic principles lead to increasing inflation, which subsequently was worsened by the vietnam war debt which required the dollar to become a floating currency (unpegged from Gold or any other commodity). 

the inflation 

the bretton woods agreement represented the main economic event of the initial revolution stage of the neoliberalism movement. bretton woods is reincarnated as Davos

# wk 6

**liberty →** as a concept defined by Hayek "freedom of the individual from restrictions"

liberty and equality are at a sharp balance even though both are jointly desired

some philosophers translate "neoliberalism" to mean "neoclassical liberalism"

in a sense, these concepts and how they are applied are essentially pinning together the rule of law

# wk 7

common thought on human behavior transitioned from religion to the "age of reason"

- 

criticisms of rational action theory

- question: "how does the impact of the twin forces of rationalism and the mechanistic-scientific worldview affect the understanding of the human behavior and ethics characteristic of classical political economy?"
- there was a bit of a push back to rational action theory in the 18th century by the romantic movement that didn't believe in such a mathematical view of human behavior.
- behaviorism is a dynamic term which offers the key idea of "**reinforcement**", a framework by which rewards/punishment are used to incentivize/de-incentivize certain kinds of behavior
	- there's the impression that rewards are a lot more effective than punishment in achieving reinforcement in either direction
	- also, random rewards are more of an incentive than scheduled reinforcement lest actors come to be used to rewards
	- another aspect to consider is the idea that rewards and punishments are subjective, not
- counters to traditional rationalism goes against
- "fable of the bees" - how is it connected with classical political economy
	- the final set of thoughts revolves around the idea that the chief sins of "gluttony", avarice, vanity, sloth, lost, wrath... these sins are seemingly necessary for the running of capitalist economies →
	- background is in the Netherlands at the early days of modern capitalism, marking the beginning of the ideology whereby making the maximum amount of money is equivalent to doing the most amount of good
	- the contrast between this "greed is good" outlook vs the traditional judeo-christian outlook on greed as a cardinal sin ⇒ this came as a result of Holland being kind of the center of the protestant movement (calvinism in a form)

		*calvinists believe that the true chosen people aren't the jews but the calvinism themselves → and that people are pre-destined (prior to birth) whether or not they go to heaven* 

		calvinist protestanism evolved into the general "people who are rich are good" and "people who are poor are bad" outlook (which was institutionally formalized as the *Dutch Reform Church* a.k.a. the racist apartheid-championing church in south africa)

		**utilitarianism** → the greatest good for the greatest many → marked an ideological transition from right/wrong to good/bad

	**looking critically at naturalism** we realize that is suggests that all incentives or driving forces on individuals come as a result of *external* forces and doesn't take into account internal motivation... while in reality, there's internal forces that actually directly determine people's behavior, and external forces are always proxied via internal forces that differ from actor to actor. indeed internal forces can be influenced by different external forces that are encountered over time, meaning that the history of an actor is also relevant to how they behave.

	an interesting way to port this contrast over to programming language theory is in comparing stateless/pure functions and stateful functions (object/classes) → stateless functions (agents who, according to naturalism, are only influenced by external factors) have their output fully determined by their input parameters and always return the same **vs** stateful functions (agents in a practical context who have dynamic internal motivations) who hold onto some internal state which might be manipulated by any parameters passed to it over a programs lifetime

the reading "Greed inc" aims to explore the dynamics of morality in how we look at the global economic system

it's interesting to think about how concepts of credit and money management are as much **moral teachings** as they are financial advice. religion was overtaken by more general concepts of morality as backed by a rational framework.

# week 8

**notes on hudson yards reading**

- this one was pretty resonant in how NY is building it's own "blank slate city" for its elite, not unlike Lagos is building Eko atlantic for it's own elite.
	- there's a pattern of elite migrating to new urban enclaves to separate themselves from the proletariat: first they moved to the suburbs, and then to the high-rise urban enclaves like hudson yards: similarly to how lagos' elite moved further along the peninsula to victoria island, lekki and then epe only to reclaim land from the sea for their new enclave in Eko Atlantic.
