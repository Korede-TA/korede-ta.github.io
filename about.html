  Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria
  </p>

  <p>
  Been living in the United States since 2016, when i came to study computer science at Drexel University
  </p>

  <p>
    At Drexel, i've served on the e-board of the school's <a href="https://nsbe.org">NSBE</a>. I also spent two quarters as an RA, which was.. a fun experience to say the least.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some of the more notable things to happen to me since 2016 have included getting an internship at Google in my freshman year. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Since then i've interned on Coinbase's infrastructure team (spring '18) and helped build parts of <a href="http://darklang.com" target="_blank">Darklang</a> in the months leading up to their launch at Strangeloop 2019.
