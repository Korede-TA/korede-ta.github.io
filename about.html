  I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria with three siblings including my twin brother Kolade. I grew up in Surulere but went to boarding school for 6 years in Iloko-Ijesha, Osun state.

  <p>
  I finished secondary school, did a gap year to work and prep for college, then moved to Philadelphia to study computer science at Drexel University.
  Notablty at Drexel, I served on the e-board of the school's <a href="https://nsbe.org" target="_blank">NSBE</a> chapter and two quarters as an RA.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2016, I've done internships at Google, Coinbase and Darklang. I got to work across Developer Tools, Infrastructure and Product, building skills around product management and customer relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was on the founding team of <a href="https://rivetapp.co" target="_blank">Rivet</a> and learned a lot, especially about leadership. It was simultaneuosly challenging and fulfilling. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   I've since moved on from that, worked on the infrastructure team at <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> and now the "workflows" team at <a href="https://metronome.com">Metronome</a>
