# Writing My Tweets

Here's something new I want to try: selecting some interesting things i've tweeted and writing out, in long form, the thoughts behind them.

I've been thinking about doing this for a few months, but I've been internally debating what the advantage of this is over just doing tweet threads. What i've convinced myself of is that blog posts represent more coherent and developed thoughts, as opposed to tweet threads which are more like spitfire broadcasts of thoughts on the edge of my mind. In writing single posts, i'm forced to build more concrete representations of my ideas and contemplations to share and to reflect upon, especially as they change over time.

Specifically, i'll be looking at tweets that represent prominent themes in my thoughts and learnings over the past couple of months. Some of these themes include pan-africanism, diversity in tech, politics (in Nigeria and elsewhere), crypto, startups (esp. in Africa), social justice, personal musings, as well as music and general creative endeavors.

I've looked back through my personal feed for some tweets that fit some of the above themes to create an initial shortlist:

This scheme will (hopefully) be a good way to get me into the habit of writing more; it's a public catalog of some potential topics to reference when i'm lacking inspiration as well as something to hold me accountable about publishing since folks will have read these plans.

I intend to add more tweets to this as I remember or tweet new stuff, but I'd also really appreciate some suggestions! If i've tweeted something somewhat recently that you'd want to see a fleshed out blog post about, please shoot me a [DM on twitter](https://twitter.com/korede_ta) and i'll do my best to write something :)
