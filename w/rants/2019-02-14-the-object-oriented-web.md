what if, instead of exposing application programming interfaces) or "APIs", software (especially web-based software) exposed document object models (DOMs), via which users can query for objects and attach events or manipulate said DOM... i feel like pulling this idea from the webpage level to the service level will help the web reach it's potential as a truly object oriented system

i think this idea is really very immense and powerful, imagine being able to utilize an API such as [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll) is used to dynamically determine how a resource can be accessed and manipulated. the object model that exposes such a resource can also be dynamically modified to accommodate whatever queries are being made to it.

other thoughts: 

- in what ways can decentralized technologies, particular content-addressable networks like IPFS, enable this vision?
