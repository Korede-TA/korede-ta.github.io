# computing as a medium

Jan 06, 2019

i've heard a lot of alan kay hype recently, and while turing awards are great and all, i feel like the thing that really got me into his cult of thinking is his emphasis on "computing as a medium".

medium is a really broad term, but it generally describes a sort of ether through which certain things (let’s call them “processes) occur. but not these processes are not the medium, nor are they distinct to the medium alone.
