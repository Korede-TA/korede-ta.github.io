# Digital Asynchrony 

Nov 13, 2018

In what ways does the internet and the digital realm enable greater (productivity through) asynchrony of our actions/processes?

We are able, for instance, to keep from being distracted from work by ordering food online in advance. Perhaps the fundamental thing that companies like amazon have done most effectively to optimize our consumptive instinct is remove the bounds of asynchrony of said consumption.
