# Contextual Leverage

Nov 13, 2018

the idea that traits or actions that give you leverage in certain spaces might not do the same in others, or even do the opposite. currently thinking about how that manifests in school: not all "learning" activities you partake in might actually affect your GPA, noone cares (for the most part) the papers you're reading on different computer architectures if you're in a course studying only basic examples. 

slightly different example is from sociological studies of youth in marginalized communities: means of artistic expression such as rap music or graffiti might be viewed as delinquency in a traditional punitive social heirarchy but equivalent expressions from youth in more equitable communities is lauded.
