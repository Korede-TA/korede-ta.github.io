january 30 2020

it's the end of the first month of 2020 and here's where i'm at. 

i've been up and down in a process of healing.

i'm optimistic but i'm not holding onto anything too dearly.

i'm currently listening to songs that sound sadder now than at any point before.

writing's been most useful for me as a way to bookmark where i am or how i feel in a certain moment.
i try not to think about the fact that anyone can read these. i fail at it but i still try.

i think it would be worthwhile to do one of these at the end of every month.
i've failed at this sort of thing before, but i'm starting to stop caring about that.

_i don't use a lot of italics here but i think i'm gonna do that more too_

in light of a new transition, i want to reflect on how my writing has changed since i started doing this. this exercise has helped me find peace
