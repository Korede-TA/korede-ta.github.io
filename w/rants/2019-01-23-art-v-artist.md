# art v artist

Jan 23, 2019

*some notes from a conversation with a friend a few months ago*

Art vs Artist. Do we separate the art from the artist? **How about we think about it in terms of elevating the art instead of the artist**, and understanding that doing one might lead to the other and vice versa (depending on certain criteria of course),.. it’s all about balance. E.g.  elevating the music of a pedophile is very likely to elevate his personality. . Art can be elevated boundlessly, but the artist cannot be elevated beyond humanity or the law and absolved of their transgressions. Hence, due to the fundamental connection to the artist, there is a bound placed on the art due to this. Because the elevation of art is not a concrete thing. There’s a place for elevating the artist in service of the art.
