# Childhood Friends

Nov 16, 2018

Keeping friends from your childhood is hard. Complications of time or distance often make old friendships disappear if you don’t put in effort. One thing that’s been on my mind today is the fact that relationships that span long periods of time, especially  those that traverse the transformative adolescent years, have to undergo a similar transformation if at all they are to persist. Perhaps, every decade or so, it’d be wise to intentionally reevaluate our longest friendships to see if they still hold despite individual transformations, as opposed to passively interacting amidst the friction of growing incompatibility.
