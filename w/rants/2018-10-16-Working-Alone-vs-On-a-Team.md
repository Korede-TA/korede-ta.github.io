# Working Alone vs On a Team

Oct 16, 2018

In terms of standard ways of organizing tasks and setting goals, I think it's important to make some key distinctions between how one does such on a personal project vs one that involves working on a team. There's a plethora of methodologies for working in teams (especially in the software industry) that work well in the multi-person setting and might help organizations scale. However, i would argue that trying to re-apply these same philosophies to the singular case is futile. In short, there needs to be more scholarship and documentation on how to work on your own. Perhaps the reverence attached to lone builders/inventors comes from the general lack of consensus around what it takes to do so. Perhaps it’s also because theres generally more variance between one individual and the other and different groups, in terms of work, that it’s harder for such a consensus to be reached.
