# synonymous interfaces

Jan 03, 2019

i've been thinking about the huge number of duplicated software products that share many user or programming interface specifics but are largely non-interoperable because of whatever propietary boundaries or the lack of a common file format.

feels like this kind of lack of interoperability for identical interfaces is very much at odds with the ideal state of computing

hoping that, in the fight against needless software complexity, we can find a way to infer bridges in synonymous interfaces and break our slavery to APIs
