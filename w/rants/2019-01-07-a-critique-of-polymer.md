# a critique of polymer

Jan 07, 2019 [incomplete]

i used [polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org) a bunch during my first internship at google and whad gotten familiar with it a few months before because ethe promise of a native API for web components seemsd really appealing to me.

in using the tool (roughly version 1.x at the time, 2.x was still in infancy), i dealt pretty closely with a number of different dynamics to how it worked, specifically in the contexts of state mtransfer through data binding and events. polymer's general philosophy was to create an API consistent with the workings of native web components (`<input>`, `<div>` e.t.c.)
