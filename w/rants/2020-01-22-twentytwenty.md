# twentytwenty

january 22 2020

i started this year in lagos. being home for the first time in a while was a challenge but i think i came out on top.

i tweeted something about learning a lot about love in 2019. i learned a lot about a lot of things and i ultimately felt like these things flowed towards expanding my capacity for love.

i _fell_ in love for the first time in 2019.

i also came to realize the great bounds of love and the various forms in which it manifests. i learned that love is in the actions, big and small. i put as much as i could into love and i learned my limits in love as well. 

i learned love is often worth pushing your limits for. but there's consequences that come with that.
