# make logs not lists

_posted: feb 19 2020, dated: july 2 2019_

make logs not lists: i don’t like to track myself or feel like i’m being given instructions by a past self (even if separated by a few hours or a few changes in mood or thinking, my past self is always at least a bit more naive or underdeveloped than my current), but it feels much better to be left a log or report from my current self that makes it feels like i’m answering to a more mature version of my self in the future

(this is something i’ve thought about for a while, only just thought to contextualize it)
